// Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

// This problem was asked by Twitter.

// Implement an autocomplete system.
// That is,
// given a query string s,
// a set of all possible query strings,
// return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

// For example,
// given the query string de,
// the set of strings [dog, deer, deal],
// return [deer, deal].

// Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.


const autoComplete = (query, strings) => {
  return []
}

const doTest = () => {

}
